## Super Resolution = Super Resolution

Improve the video resolution through some specific algorithms, that is, increase the resolution of each frame of the video to make the look and feel clearer.

Common algorithms include [BICUBIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicubic_interpolation), [LANCZOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_algorithm), etc., which are not implemented by AI, commonly known as "hard pull ".

SVFI uses deep network-based artificial intelligence algorithm [RealESR](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN), [RealCUGAN](https://github.com/bilibili/ailab/tree/main/Real- CUGAN) for super-scoring, and its super-scoring effect on animation is better than other algorithms.

::: tip
For the processing task of the same video, SVFI will perform super-resolution first, and then perform frame supplementation
