## SVFI Getting Started Guide V1.0

​ Welcome to use Squirrel Video Frame Interpolation software. This software is dedicated to upgrading stuttering low frame rate video to smooth high frame rate video.

::: tip
The following is a basic tutorial to increase a video's fps using SVFI's VFI functions.
:::

Regardless of whether you have had any similar VFI experience before, please believe that if you follow the process below, you will have a pleasant user experience.

1. Make sure that your graphics card meets the minimum requirements of this software: **GTX 750Ti** and above, **Maxwell** graphics card or above. If you do not meet this requirement, please refund in time, and switch to  using other vfi software.

1. Wait for the software to start, you will see the following page. This is the **main interface** of SVFI. Please note that this tutorial covers *3.x* versions only.
   - To perform VFI on a **video**, you first need to select the option ❶ "input video file" below, and select the video to be complemented in the pop-up file selection window.
   - You can also "drag" videos directly into the window ❶.

5. After entering a video, we need to make some basic settings.

   - First: From option ❶ "Set Output Folder" select the location of the video with VFI, i.e. **Output Folder**. If not specified, the output video will be in the folder where the input video is located.

   - Set option ❷ "Output File Format" to determine whether the video format is *.mp4, .mkv or .mov*. The *mp4* file is more versatile, *mkv* supports more types of audio, and *mov* is used mostly in production scenarios, generally For Apple Eco Clips. 
   
   ::: tip
   Please keep it the same with the input video. If the format of the input video is not among the above three, use mkv.
   :::

   - You will find the frame rate of the input video has been displayed on the left of option ❸. You can directly select the frame rate multiplier of the supplementary frame in option ❸ "VFI", or manually fill in the frame rate in ❹ "Output Frame Rate". **You can fill in as many as you want, 60 or 120 will do**, SVFI will handle everything for you.

1. Congratulations, you have completed all the necessary settings, now click ❺**One-click frame completion**, you can go to make a cup of coffee and wait for the output result in the output folder.
   - Before clicking ❺**One-click Run**, in order to prevent errors, please close any other software that may occupy video memory.
   - If the software still has an error, or you do not see the output video you are thinking about in the output folder, please go to [FAQ](/pages/9cc27d) for possible solutions;
