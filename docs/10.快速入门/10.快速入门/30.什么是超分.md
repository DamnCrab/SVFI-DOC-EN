## SR = Super Resolution = Upscale

::: warning
This entry needs to be supplemented
:::

Increase the video resolution through some specific algorithms, that is, increase the resolution of each frame of the video to make the video look clearer.

::: tip
For the processing task of the same video, SVFI will perform SR first, then perform VFI.
:::

Traditional algorithms include non-AI [BICUBIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicubic_interpolation), [LANCZOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_algorithm), etc. SVFI uses advanced artificial intelligence algorithms [RealESR](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN), [RealCUGAN](https://github.com/bilibili/ailab/tree/main/Real-CUGAN) and other SR algorithms for upscaling, whose overall performances on animation outperform other algorithms.

Demo:
::: cardImgList
```yaml
config:
    target: _blank
    imgHeight: auto
    objectFit: contain
    lineClamp: 1
