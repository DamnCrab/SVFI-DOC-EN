## VFI = Video Frame Interpolation

::: warning
This entry needs to be supplemented
:::

The video frame rate is increased by some specific algorithms, that is, new frames that are not included in the original video are inserted between the original frames to make video smoother in motion.

Traditional VFI algorithms are mostly "based" on hardware [MEMC](), or software based [optical flow](). SVFI uses advanced artificial intelligence algorithm [RIFE and its derivatives](https://github.com/megvii-research/ECCV2022-RIFE) for VFI, whose overall performances outperform other algorithms.

Demo:

::: cardImgList
```yaml
config:
    target: _blank
    imgHeight: auto
    objectFit: contain
    lineClamp: 1
