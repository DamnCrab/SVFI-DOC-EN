Before you use the software, please make sure you read the following.

  **If there is no corresponding format, we recommend you to choose mkv format**

- Set the output folder to a disk with more space left if possible, and try not to set it to a removable drive disk.
- The remaining space on the system disk should not be less than 1G.
- Check "Export with or without audio" before starting the task, if it is checked, the audio subtitle track of the original video can be retained without loss

Mouse hovering over the audio track with (?) or (!) option will bring up a floating window with instructions for use. It is recommended to read these instructions carefully before adjusting the default settings of the software, it will save you a lot of time!
